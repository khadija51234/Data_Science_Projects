# Titanic Project

This folder contains my Titanic dataset project.
It includes data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation steps.

# **Titanic Dataset Classification & Visualization**

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to understand passenger demographics and survival patterns.  
It was created in Google Colab and uploaded to GitHub for sharing and review.

## **📊 Visualizations**
The following plots were created:

- **Age Distribution (Histogram)** – shows how passengers’ ages are distributed.
- **Sex vs. Survival (Countplot)** – compares survival between male and female passengers.
- **Pclass vs. Survival (Countplot)** – compares survival across ticket classes.
- **Fare Distribution (Histogram)** – shows the fare amounts paid by passengers.
- **Top Ticket Numbers (Barplot)** – displays the most frequent ticket numbers.
  
## ** 📈 Survival Summary by Sex**
The dataset shows a clear difference between male and female passengers:

- **Total Male Passengers:** 577 – fewer survived.  
- **Total Female Passengers:** 314 – higher proportion survived.  

✅ This shows that females had a much higher chance of survival compared to males.

 ## **⚙️ Machine Learning Model**
A Logistic Regression model is trained on the cleaned dataset to predict passenger survival.

**Steps included:**
- Encoding categorical features (like `Sex`)
- Handling missing values
- Training and evaluating the model

  ## **📝 Note**
This project was created as part of an assignment to classify and visualize the Titanic dataset.This analysis shows the demographic patterns and survival trends of the Titanic passengers.
