## Steps Included
1. Data Collection  
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Model Building (Linear Regression)  
5. Model Evaluation (RMSE, R²)  
6. Visualizations  
   - Actual vs Predicted Closing Price  
   - Residual Plot  
   - Future Predictions (next 30 days)  


## Model Performance
- **Training RMSE:** 0.34  
- **Testing RMSE:** 0.34  
- **Training R²:** 0.9999  
- **Testing R²:** 0.9999  


## Future Predictions
- Predicted the next 30 days of stock closing prices  
- Visualized the trend with line plots

## Note
- The model used here is **Linear Regression**, chosen for simplicity and interpretability.  
- Predictions are based on historical data; real stock prices may vary due to market fluctuations.  
- The future prediction plot shows the **next 30 days** based on the latest available data row.  
- This project is for **educational purposes** and should not be used for actual trading decisions.
